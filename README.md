An API that serves as the backend for a phone book app, providing a list of people and their contact details.

Made with Node.js + TypeScript + TypeORM + PostgreSQL within a 3 hour limit.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Setup

## üß† Design Decisions

Walkthrough of design decisions their final verdicts.

### Programming Language

|   | JavaScript  | TypeScript  |
| :------------: | ------------ | ------------ |
| pros      |  Easier to write, little to no initial setup  | Easier to debug, quicker development  |
|  cons |   Potentially more errors at runtime   |  More initial setup, additional learning curve |

#### Verdict

While JavaScript requires less setup and is less convoluted to write, it would therefore suit a small project such as this one. However, in an effort to avoid errors at runtime, I am picking TypeScript for the project. After the initial setup it should be straight forward to use due to previous exposure to TypeScript and having experience with other statically typed languages.
